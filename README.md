**Sentiment to Stocks: Forecasting Israel's Market Leaders**

In the dynamic landscape of global financial markets, recent geopolitical events, particularly the 
Israel-Palestine conflict, have instigated substantial fluctuations in stock prices, necessitating a 
nuanced analysis of investor sentiment. As financial stakeholders strive to comprehend the market 
dynamics amidst geopolitical uncertainties, this study endeavors to employ advanced machine 
learning methodologies, including sentiment analysis, to predict stock prices for five multinational 
corporations: Checkpoint (CHKP), Lundin Mining Corp (LUMI.TA), Mobileye (MBLY), NICE 
Ltd (NICE), and Poli Ltd (POLI.TA). 

By amalgamating daily stock datasets from Yahoo Finance with sentiment data derived from 
Reddit discussions, our objective is to provide comprehensive predictions of stock price trends 
while shedding light on the public perception of these multinational corporations amidst 
geopolitical uncertainties. The parallels drawn from the success of machine learning models, 
including Random Forest Regression, Linear Regression, and Support Vector Regression, are 
integral to our approach, enabling the identification of the most accurate predictors of stock prices. 

Beyond the immediate scope of the Israel-Palestine conflict, the versatility of our proposed 
pipeline renders it adaptable for sentiment and stock data analysis for any publicly traded company. 
As a valuable tool for future research and applications, the pipeline's adaptability is underscored 
by the potential integration of a user-friendly front end and parameterization of data pipeline 
components. Such enhancements promise heightened usability, efficiency, and scalability, 
offering tailored insights to users and seamless integration with other tools and technologies in the 
financial analytics domain.
